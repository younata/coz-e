# Introduction - The Coz-E

This is the build log (and other relevant information) for my cozy-derived electric canard airplane.

You can think of this as a [Cozy Mark IV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cozy_MK_IV) with the rear seats replaced with a large battery compartment and an electric motor. Because that's what it will be.

Unlike [my digital garden](https://knowledge.rachelbrindle.com), which provides more generic knowledge and things I've gathered, this site is intended to scope down to the Coz-E.

There is an [rss feed to track updated articles here](/atom.xml). You can also paste any article's URL into your rss reader and it should discover the feed.
