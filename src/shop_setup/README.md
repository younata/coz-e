# Shop Setup

Here's how I set up my shop for this:

You'll need a lot of workbench space. I [designed my own 2'x4' workbench]({{#path_for Workbench}}), and plan to build 6 of them.

Additionally, you need a bunch of storage space. I built a [cabinet to store fiberglass in]({{#path_for Fiberglass Cabinet}}), which has space underneath it

Future known work includes:

- Box to store and heat epoxy.

Additionally, I also have some [printouts of information good to have visible in the shop]({{#path_for Printouts}}).
