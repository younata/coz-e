# Printouts

Notes to print out and place in a visible place in the shop.

Here we have:

- [Materials](materials.md) is good info on making epoxy, with QR codes for the epoxy and glass bubbles MSDS.
- [Basic Layup Procedure](layups.md) is more-or-less a transcription of Chapter 3, page 19. I didn't want to rip it out of the plans and hang it out on the wall.
