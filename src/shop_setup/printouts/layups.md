# Basic Layup Procedure

<!-- This is an updated copy of the Basic Layup Procedure page, from Chapter 3, page 19 of the Cozy Mark IV plans -->

1. Preparation: Ply \#9 or Gloves (Nitrile preferred) on hands, shop temperature 75° F ± 10 °. Don't do the layup unless you know the shop will stay within this range during the entire curing time.
2. Cloth Cutting: Use the electric scissors.
  - Unless otherwise specified, cut at 45° to the fibers.
3. Surface preparation:
  - Foam: Hot-wire-cut surface needs no preparation. Sand ledges or bumps even. Fill holes or gouges with dry micro immediately prior to layup. Vacuum up the dust.
  - Glass: **Always** sand to completely dull any cured glass surface with 36 or 60 grit sandpaper. Re-sand if it has been touched with greasy fingers.
  - Metal: Dull with 220 grit sandpaper.
4. Mix Epoxy:
  - Mix for 2 minutes.
  - 80% stirring, 20% scraping sides and bottom.
  - **Hot cup: Throw it away and mix more.** A hot cup indicates exotherm.
  - Don't use a brush to stir.
  - Micro Slurry: Approximately equal volume of mixed epoxy & glass bubbles.
  - Wet Micro: Add enough bubbles for a "thick honey" mix.
  - Dry Micro: Enough bubbles so it won't run.
  - Wet Flox: Thick, but pourable mixture of mixed epoxy & flocked cotton.
  - **Applying to surface**:
    - Over foam: brush or squeegee on a thin micro slurry layer (urethane foam: Use a thick micro slurry layer).
    - Over glass: Brush on a coat of epoxy.
5. Lay on cloth:
  - Pull edges to straighten wrinkles.
  - If working alone: Roll the cloth, then unroll it onto the surface.
6. Wet Out:
  - Don't slop on excess resin; Bring epoxy up with a vertical stab of the brush (This is stippling)
  - Start in center and work out to sides.
  - *Most* of the time in a layup is spent stippling. Stipple resin up from below, or, if required, down from above.
  - **"Not wet, not white"**.
7. Squeegee:
  - If you have excess epoxy, squeegee it off to the side. Use squeegee with many light passes to move epoxy from wet areas to dry areas.
8. Preliminary Contour Fill
  - Save sanding by troweling dry micro over low areas while the glass layup is still tacky.
  - This is done at trailing edges, spar caps, or over any low areas.
    - The low places are overfilled with micro, then sanded smooth after full cure.
9. Knife Trim:
  - Razor-trim the edges at the "knife trim" stage, about 3-4 hours after the layup.
  - Alternatively: Wait until a full cure, then use the variable oscillating tool to knife trim.
10. General Inspection:
  - Look for dry glass, excess epoxy, bubbles, and delamination before walking away from wet layup.
11. Cleanup:
  - Remove gloves, or rinse ply \#9 off with soap and water.
  - Epocleanse can also remove epoxy off unprotected skin areas.
  - Brushes: Rinse twice with MEK, and wash with soap and water. Throw away after 2-4 uses.
