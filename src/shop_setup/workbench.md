These are heavily inspired by the <a href="http://www.eaa1000.av.org/technicl/worktabl/worktabl.htm" data-proofer-ignore>EAA Chapter 1000 Standardized Work Tables</a>, only designed to to be 2 feet by 4 feet instead of 2 feet by 5 feet. A bunch of people in the cozy community prefer joining 6 tables of these size to ultimately create the plans-recommended 12 foot by 4 foot table for the wings and other large pieces. This is my take on that.

## Materials

This is made using 2x4 studs and plywood, held together using simple woodworking joints, with wood glue and screws to supplement.

- 2" x 4" studs (which should actually measure 1.5" x 3.5")
  - 2x 48" studs
  - 3x 24" studs
  - 4x 32" studs
  - 2x 37" studs
  - 3x 16" studs
- Plywood
  - 1x 48" x 24" x 3/4" plywood "project board".
  - 1x 34" x 16" x 1/2" plywood "project board".

To minimize material needed to buy, you can buy 6x 8' studs, and have the lumber yard cut them to size.

## Instructions

First, we're going to build the frame, then screw in the table and shelf tops.

1. Top Frame
  - Cut half-laps into the 48" studs. These will have a depth of 1.75" (half the height of the studs). They should be 1.5" long (the width of the studs). Cut 2 of them 4" from the edges, then a third in the exact center of the 48" stud (starts 23.25" from either edge). Make these cuts all on the same side.
  - Cut rabbets into 3 of the 24" studs. These will be at the ends of the studs. As before, they'll be 1.75" deep, and 1.5" long. Make these cuts all on the same side.
  - Join the 48" studs with the 24" studs you just cut into. The correct orientation for this is that the 24" will slot down into the 48" (so that, when weight is placed on the 24" studs, they'll transfer that weight into the 48" studs)
2. Legs
  - Cut rabbets and half-laps into the 32" studs. These will have a depth of 1.5", and a length of 3.5". The half-lap should be made on the other end (but same side) of the stud. The half-lap cut should be inset 4" from the end it's cut on.
  - Join the rabbet from these studs into the inside corners of the 48" studs and the 24" studs of the top-frame.
3. Bottom Shelf
  - Cut 3 half-laps into the 37" studs. All these should be 1.75" deep, and 1.5" long. 2 of them should be inset 1.5" from the ends, and the third should be in the dead center (starting 17.75" from the ends).
  - Cut 2 rabbets into the 16" studs. Similar to above, these should be 1.75" deep and 1.5" long.
  - Join the 37" studs into the legs from earlier, into the unused half-lap cuts near the bottom.
  - Join the 16" studs into the 27" studs.
4. Surfaces
  - Screw the surfaces to their respective places (the 4'x2' plywood sheet should screw into the top, the 34"x16" sheet should screw into the bottom).
