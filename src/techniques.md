Various techniques used in fiberglassing.

## BID Taping

Don't apply BID tape like a standard layup. You want to apply it already-wet and pre-trimmed. This is faster and has a cleaner result.

1. Create a plastic backing that is a little oversized for the final tape.
2. With a marker, draw the desired length & width of the BID on that plastic.
3. Layup the BID inside of it. Layup all of the plies you'll need in this. Be sure to squeegee out the air bubbles between layers.
4. Once you're done with the layup, put on a layer of peel ply and then another layer of plastic. So that you have this BID tape sandwiched between the plastic.
5. Flip the entire thing over, and cut the plastic to the desired shape, following the lines you previously drew.
6. Pull off the now-cut plastic (on the non-peel-ply'd side), and gently press the tape into place. Go over this with a clean squeegee to remove air bubbles.
7. Once the epoxy is in the green stage, pull off the plastic and peel ply.
