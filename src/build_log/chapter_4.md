# Chapter 4 - Bulkheads, Instrument Panel, Front Seatback and Temporary Firewall

Chapter 4 starts off fairly simple - you're working entirely with flat shapes that are all internal to the aircraft. The only curves are the edges.

Current status (Late August, 2022): Still in progress.

## Front Seatback

Status: Finished! ✅

The front seatback is very simple - cut down a slab of 0.75" thick foam, shape two of the edges to be 45°, and glass it. Following the advice of other builders, I used a tablesaw to make those cuts. You can see the result below.

A few days later, I did the next step, which is to add micro and UNI fiberglass to one side. I interpreted "micro" in this case to be wet micro, not micro slurry. We'll see how it turns out.

I cut out 2 lengths (approximately 42-45 inches) of full-width UNI and laid them out. I had to cut and rearrange the glass while laying it out, and there was some excess, but this worked well. Instead of using the polyester sheet as peel ply, like I had [previously]({{#path_for Chapter 3 - Education and Practice Layups}}), I used plastic sheeting. We'll see how it turns out.

As you can see, it turned out fine. I did go back to using polyester peel ply for the aft side of the front seatback. Which also turned out fine and was relatively easy to pull out.

I identified a number of inconsistencies in the epoxy cure on both sides, and will be drilling holes and injecting epoxy into them once it warms up and I'm sure the injected epoxy will correctly cure.

## F-28 Bulkhead

Status: Finished! ✅

The F-28 Bulkhead is a relatively small piece, and will be made of fiberglass glassed onto clark foam. I cut the foam out using a utility knife and a Fein tool.

One side turned out better than the other. The first side I glassed, I put down a significantly thicker layer of wet micro than I should have. I determined that while that wasn't enough of an issue to warrant remaking the part, and made a note to only place a thin layer of wet micro when I did the other side.

The image below is a composite image of both sides of the F-28 bulkhead, which shows the differences in the layup. Each side is labeled for convenience, both sides of F-28 received the same amount of fiberglass.

## F-22 Bulkhead

Status: Remaking entirely.

Tip: When adding the doubler, be sure to apply wet micro to both sides of the doubler. Micro is supposed to applied to every side of foam that touches glass.

I had built out one F-22 bulkhead, with the aft face looking pretty decent. However, I had made a number of errors glassing the forward side. These errors were such that I'd essentially have to strip most of the fiberglass from the forward side. Additionally, after discussing this with other people, I realized that I had added way too much wet micro to the foam. With both of those, I made the decision to remake the F-22 bulkhead entirely.

For the second go around, I had ordered more clark foam to use. Which meant I could be way more liberal with material usage as this high-density clark foam is not used after this chapter. This meant that I could minimize the amount of joins I needed to make, which made things a little bit easier. I still haven't glassed this second attempt.

## Instrument Panel

Status: Both sides glassed. Horizontal Stiffeners epoxied. Need to glass them & add vertical stiffeners.

The Instrument Panel is a little bit larger than the F-22 bulkhead. I made this by cutting pieces of it out of clark foam, and them gluing them together with 5-minute epoxy. Afterwards (much later in my case), I laid up both sides with 2 layers of BID everywhere, and then a layer of UNI running top span only.

I chose to attach and glass the stiffeners in 6 parts: First, I attached the horizontal stiffeners, which largely run across the upper span of the instrument panel. Second, I glassed the upper part of those stiffeners. Third, I glassed the lower part of those stiffeners. Which includes adding the "lip" to run wire channels and harnesses through. Fourth, I attached the vertical stiffeners, which run vertically along the center span of the instrument panel. Fifth, I glassed the inner parts of the vertical stiffeners (which don't have a lip on them). Lastly, I glassed the outer part of the vertical stiffeners. I went with this order so that the fiberglass used for the lower-horizontal stiffener would already be in place when I attached the vertical stiffeners. Additionally, I didn't want to deal with trying to add fiberglass underneath one of the "lips". For all of this glassing, I used [BID tape]({{#path_for Fiberglassing Techniques#bid-taping}}) with either 1 or 2 plies of BID, as called out in the plans.

## Landing Gear Bulkheads

Status:

| Upper Forward Landing Gear Bulkhead | Lower Forward Landing Gear Bulkhead | Aft Landing Gear Bulkhead |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Foam core is cut. Glassed forward side. Need to glass aft side. | Foam core & hardpoints are cut. | Foam core & hardpoints are cut. Need to join & glass them. |

For all three of these bulkheads, I initially misread the plans and made them out of high-density clark foam like the other bulkheads are. These should be made out of lower-density PVC foam, which I am working on remaking these with. Thankfully, I had not done much other than assemble the foam core of the bulkheads.

When I remade them with the correct foam, I was able to cut them in one piece - no epoxying with 5-minute epoxy required.

I made  12 inch by 8 inch sheets of 22 ply BID fiberglass for the bulkhead hardpoints. Which is enough to make 8 hardpoints. Which has turned out to be a good mistake because I irreparably damaged 2 of them with my trim router while I was trying to trim them to their final shape.

![Damaged forward landing gear bulkheads](/assets/images/build_log/chapter_4/aft_landing_gear_hardpoints_damaged.jpg)

Tip: If you're using a handheld router, hold the router with both hands. Don't try to hold it with one hand, and a vacuum hose (for dust collection) with the other. I was lucky and didn't get hurt when this happened.

My second attempt was much more successful. I didn't bother with the router at all, and cut the fiberglass with an oscillating tool. I used a belt sander for final shaping, and it came out quite well.

As of this writing, I have yet to join the hardpoints with the foam.

## Firewall

Status: Temporary firewall complete, awaiting alodyne for the permanent firewall.

I have built a temporary firewall, and I have also made the cuts for the permanent firewall. I'm putting off glassing them because I decided to alodyne the aluminum parts prior to inserting them into the firewall. Which I'm still waiting for that to arrive.

Temporary firewall, cut from a large 4x8 sheet of 1/8 inch birch ply I got from a big box store. It's terrible wood, but that doesn't matter because it's not going to fly.

There's still some small amount tape that's under some cured epoxy. Because of the location, the best I think I can do is scrape at it with a knife.
