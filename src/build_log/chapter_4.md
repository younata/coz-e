# Chapter 4 - Bulkheads, Instrument Panel, Front Seatback and Temporary Firewall

Chapter 4 starts off fairly simple - you're working entirely with flat shapes that are all internal to the aircraft. The only curves are the edges.

Current status (Late May, 2022): In early May 2022, I had a minisplit installed in my workshop. Since then, I have done at least an hour of work a day in the workshop. Work is thus proceeding at a brisk pace, and I hope to complete chapter 4 by mid June.

## Front Seatback

The front seatback is very simple - cut down a slab of 0.75" thick foam, shape two of the edges to be 45°, and glass it. Following the advice of other builders, I used a tablesaw to make those cuts. You can see the result below.

A few days later, I did the next step, which is to add micro and UNI fiberglass to one side. I interpreted "micro" in this case to be wet micro, not micro slurry. We'll see how it turns out.

I cut out 2 lengths (approximately 42-45 inches) of full-width UNI and laid them out. I had to cut and rearrange the glass while laying it out, and there was some excess, but this worked well. Instead of using the polyester sheet as peel ply, like I had [previously]({{#path_for Chapter 3 - Education and Practice Layups}}), I used plastic sheeting. We'll see how it turns out.

As you can see, it turned out fine. I did go back to using polyester peel ply for the aft side of the front seatback. Which also turned out fine and was relatively easy to pull out.

I identified a number of inconsistencies in the epoxy cure on both sides, and will be drilling holes and injecting epoxy into them once it warms up and I'm sure the injected epoxy will correctly cure.

## F-28 Bulkhead

The F-28 Bulkhead is a relatively small piece, and will be made of fiberglass glassed onto clark foam. I cut the foam out using a utility knife and a Fein tool.

I have glassed one side of the F-28 bulkhead.

## F-22 Bulkhead

The F-28 Bulkhead is the first piece that I need to build in pieces, then epoxy together. Similar to the F-28 bulkhead, I cut this out of clark foam using a utility knife and a Fein tool, and then sanding for a more precise finish.

When adding the doubler, be sure to apply wet micro to both sides of the doubler. Micro is supposed to applied to every side of foam that touches glass.

A week after glassing the aft face (including the doubler), I glassed the forward face of the F-22 bulkhead. Currently awaiting curing.

## Instrument Panel

The Instrument Panel is roughly the same size as the F-22 bulkhead. It's current state is also foam pieces, epoxied together with 5-minute epoxy. Along with the other bulkheads, I have not yet glassed it.

Additionally, I need to cut out and prepare the stiffeners and cable channels for the instrument panel. Which, per plans, I'll do after glassing both sides.

I have glassed one side of the Instrument Panel. Currently awaiting curing.

## Landing Gear Bulkheads

Along with the other bulkheads, the landing gear bulkheads have had their foam parts cut out and epoxied together with 5-minute epoxy.

I made  12 inch by 8 inch sheets of 22 ply BID fiberglass for the bulkhead hardpoints. Which is enough to make 8 hardpoints. Which has turned out to be a good mistake because I irreparably damaged 2 of them with my trim router while I was trying to trim them to their final shape.

Tip: If you're using a handheld router, hold the router with both hands. Don't try to hold it with one hand, and a vacuum hose (for dust collection) with the other. I was lucky and didn't get hurt when this happened. Get an assistant to help with dust collection - fiberglass dust is toxic, after all.

When I try again, I will also 3d print templates of the hardpoints, which I will use as a guide with a trim bit so that I can even more precisely shape the fiberglass to the desired shape.

## Firewall

I have built a temporary firewall, and I have also cut out parts of the permanent firewall. I need to cut out the remaining pieces of the permanent firewall, as well as glass them. I have alodyne on order from Aircraft spruce. I'll use that to protect the aluminum parts prior to inserting them into the firewall. Once the alodyne arrives, I'll complete work on the firewall.

Temporary firewall, cut from a large 4x8 sheet of 1/8 inch birch ply I got from a big box store. It's terrible wood, but that doesn't matter because it's not going to fly.
