# Chapter 4 - Bulkheads, Instrument Panel, Front Seatback and Temporary Firewall

Chapter 4 starts off fairly simple - you're working entirely with flat shapes that are all internal to the aircraft. The only curves are the edges.

Current status (Mid July, 2022): In early May 2022, I had a minisplit installed in my workshop. While I'm able to work quickly on this, I've had a few setbacks and Real-Life-Interruptions that keep this work ongoing.

## Front Seatback

Status: Finished! ✅

The front seatback is very simple - cut down a slab of 0.75" thick foam, shape two of the edges to be 45°, and glass it. Following the advice of other builders, I used a tablesaw to make those cuts. You can see the result below.

A few days later, I did the next step, which is to add micro and UNI fiberglass to one side. I interpreted "micro" in this case to be wet micro, not micro slurry. We'll see how it turns out.

I cut out 2 lengths (approximately 42-45 inches) of full-width UNI and laid them out. I had to cut and rearrange the glass while laying it out, and there was some excess, but this worked well. Instead of using the polyester sheet as peel ply, like I had [previously]({{#path_for Chapter 3 - Education and Practice Layups}}), I used plastic sheeting. We'll see how it turns out.

As you can see, it turned out fine. I did go back to using polyester peel ply for the aft side of the front seatback. Which also turned out fine and was relatively easy to pull out.

I identified a number of inconsistencies in the epoxy cure on both sides, and will be drilling holes and injecting epoxy into them once it warms up and I'm sure the injected epoxy will correctly cure.

## F-28 Bulkhead

Status: Finished! ✅

The F-28 Bulkhead is a relatively small piece, and will be made of fiberglass glassed onto clark foam. I cut the foam out using a utility knife and a Fein tool.

One side turned out better than the other. The first side I glassed, I put down a significantly thicker layer of wet micro than I should have. I determined that while that wasn't enough of an issue to warrant remaking the part, and made a note to only place a thin layer of wet micro when I did the other side.

The image below is a composite image of both sides of the F-28 bulkhead, which shows the differences in the layup. Each side is labeled for convenience, both sides of F-28 received the same amount of fiberglass.

## F-22 Bulkhead

Status: Remaking entirely.

Tip: When adding the doubler, be sure to apply wet micro to both sides of the doubler. Micro is supposed to applied to every side of foam that touches glass.

I had built out one F-22 bulkhead, with the aft face looking pretty decent. However, I had made a number of errors glassing the forward side. These errors were such that I'd essentially have to strip most of the fiberglass from the forward side. Additionally, after discussing this with other people, I realized that I had added way too much wet micro to the foam. With both of those, I made the decision to remake the F-22 bulkhead entirely.

## Instrument Panel

Status: 1 side glassed, awaiting glassing the other side. Need to cut out and add stiffeners/cable channels.

The Instrument Panel is roughly the same size as the F-22 bulkhead. It's current state is also foam pieces, epoxied together with 5-minute epoxy. Along with the other bulkheads, I have not yet glassed it.

Additionally, I need to cut out and prepare the stiffeners and cable channels for the instrument panel. Which, per plans, I'll do after glassing both sides.

I have glassed one side of the Instrument Panel, and it turned out acceptably. I trimmed the fiberglass from the edges, and am awaiting glassing the other side.

## Landing Gear Bulkheads

Status:

| Upper Forward Landing Gear Bulkhead | Lower Forward Landing Gear Bulkhead | Aft Landing Gear Bulkhead |
|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Foam core is cut. Need to glass. | Foam core is cut, need to cut hardpoints. | Foam core & hardpoints are cut. Need to join & glass them. |

For all three of these bulkheads, I initially misread the plans and made them out of high-density clark foam like the other bulkheads are. These should be made out of lower-density PVC foam, which I am working on remaking these with. Thankfully, I had not done much other than assemble the foam core of the bulkheads.

When I remade them with the correct foam, I was able to cut them in one piece - no epoxying with 5-minute epoxy required.

I made  12 inch by 8 inch sheets of 22 ply BID fiberglass for the bulkhead hardpoints. Which is enough to make 8 hardpoints. Which has turned out to be a good mistake because I irreparably damaged 2 of them with my trim router while I was trying to trim them to their final shape.

Tip: If you're using a handheld router, hold the router with both hands. Don't try to hold it with one hand, and a vacuum hose (for dust collection) with the other. I was lucky and didn't get hurt when this happened.

When I try again, I will also 3d print templates of the hardpoints, which I will use as a guide with a trim bit so that I can even more precisely shape the fiberglass to the desired shape.

## Firewall

Status: Temporary firewall complete, awaiting alodyne for the permanent firewall.

I have built a temporary firewall, and I have also cut out parts of the permanent firewall. I need to cut out the remaining pieces of the permanent firewall, as well as glass them. I have alodyne on order from Aircraft spruce. I'll use that to protect the aluminum parts prior to inserting them into the firewall. Once the alodyne arrives, I'll complete work on the firewall.

Temporary firewall, cut from a large 4x8 sheet of 1/8 inch birch ply I got from a big box store. It's terrible wood, but that doesn't matter because it's not going to fly.
