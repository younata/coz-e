# Chapter 4 - Bulkheads, Instrument Panel, Front Seatback and Temporary Firewall

Chapter 4 starts off fairly simple - you're mostly working with flat things that are all internal to the aircraft. Some curves, but no complex curves.

## Front Seatback

The front seatback is very simple - cut down a slab of 0.75" thick foam, shape two of the edges to be 45Â°, and glass it. Following the advice of other builders, I used a tablesaw to make those cuts. You can see the result below.

A few days later, I did the next step, which is to add micro and UNI fiberglass to one side. I interpreted "micro" in this case to be wet micro, not micro slurry. We'll see how it turns out.

I cut out 2 lengths (approximately 42-45 inches) of full-width UNI and laid them out. I had to cut and rearrange the glass while laying it out, and there was some excess, but this worked well. Instead of using the polyester sheet as peel ply, like I had [previously]({{#path_for Chapter 3 - Education and Practice Layups}}), I used plastic sheeting. We'll see how it turns out.

## F-28 Bulkhead

The F-28 Bulkhead is a relatively small piece. In the future, I hope to build a CNC router to handle cutting foam for me. In the now, I'm cutting manually using a utility knife and a Fein tool.

Currently, I have the F-28 bulkhead cut, but have not glassed it. I don't have a good solution to handling cold temperatures in my workshop yet. So I'm currently electing to cut as much foam as I can, planning to line up a bunch of pieces to fiberglass work as soon as it warms up enough for epoxy to set right.

## F-22 Bulkhead

The F-28 Bulkhead is the first piece that I need to build in pieces, then epoxy together. Similar to the F-28 bulkhead, I cut this out of clark foam using a utility knife and a Fein tool, and then sanding for a more precise finish.

Similarly to the F-28 bulkhead, this currently is cut in pieces, and I will epoxy this together then ultimately glass it once it warms up.

## Instrument Panel

The Instrument Panel is roughly the same size as the F-22 bulkhead. And it's current state is also foam pieces, and I'm currently working to cut out more pieces of the instrument panel.
