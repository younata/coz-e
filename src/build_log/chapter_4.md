# Chapter 4 - Bulkheads, Instrument Panel, Front Seatback and Temporary Firewall

Chapter 4 starts off fairly simple - you're mostly working with flat things that are all internal to the aircraft. Some curves, but no complex curves.

## Front Seatback

The front seatback is very simple - cut down a slab of 0.75" thick foam, shape two of the edges to be 45Â°, and glass it. Following the advice of other builders, I used a tablesaw to make those cuts. You can see the result below.

A few days later, I did the next step, which is to add micro and UNI fiberglass to one side. I interpreted "micro" in this case to be wet micro, not micro slurry. We'll see how it turns out.

I cut out 2 lengths (approximately 42-45 inches) of full-width UNI and laid them out. I had to cut and rearrange the glass while laying it out, and there was some excess, but this worked well. Instead of using the polyester sheet as peel ply, like I had [previously]({{#path_for Chapter 3 - Education and Practice Layups}}), I used plastic sheeting. We'll see how it turns out.
