# Build Log

This section is meant to describe the build log for the aircraft, and will roughly reflect the chapters in the Cozy Mark IV plans.

Because the sidebar will last chapters in [lexicographical order](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45950646/what-is-lexicographical-order), I'll also list the build-order here.

- [Chapter 3 - Education]({{#path_for Chapter 3 - Education and Practice Layups}})
- [Chapter 4 - Bulkheads, Instrument Panel, Front Seatback and Temporary Firewall]({{#path_for Chapter 4 - Bulkheads, Instrument Panel, Front Seatback and Temporary Firewall}})
