# Chapter 6 - Fuselage Assembly

Rejoice! At the end of this, you'll actually have something to show to people instead of just mostly flat panels.

Now that the fuselage [bulkheads](chapter_4.md) and [sides](chapter_5.md) have been built, it's time to put them together.

Current status (Mid December, 2022): Just barely started.

## Fuselage Side Assembly

I decided to assemble my fuselage upside-down, as suggested and made popular by [Wayne Hicks](https://ez.canardaircraft.com/www.ez.org/pages/waynehicks/chapter_06.html).

I struggled a lot with building the platform to do the assembly on. It's incredibly important that this platform be level and square and I had extreme difficulty figuring out a wood structure that would suffice. My existing workbenches, which worked fine for holding the fuselage form jigs, would not work for this. I decided to purchase some aluminum extrusion and construct a work surface with that. The extrusion is machined to much higher tolerances than what I can get for wood. While I waited for the aluminum to arrive, I worked on the center keel.

## Center Keel and Seatback Brace

The center keel adds strength to the fuselage, and contains the hot air duct (likely unused for me, but that duct is still a structural component, so I'm keeping it). It's the base of the center console and is part of the mounting point for the safety harnesses. Additionally, the fuel selector valve nominally in the center keel, but I don't need to install that, so I'm not going to work on that.

You start the center keel by first microing and glassing foam, then cutting it out. I marked the shapes in black sharpie on the foam, then I micro'd and glassed it. The triangular pieces are received 2 layers of BID, any orientation. I chose diagonal with respect to the base. The rectangular pieces received 2 layers of UNI, oriented along the length of the piece.

## The Fuselage Bottom

With the sides assembled, now it's time to install a floor.
