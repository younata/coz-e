# Chapter 5 - Fuselage Sides

Chapter 4 was about making a bunch of bulkheads which are all internal to the fuselage structure. Chapter 5 involves making external parts - the fuselage sides.

The FJ* jigs are used for shaping the longerons and providing a shape for the foam that will be epoxied. I have a desktop 3d printer, and decided that as much as possible, I should try to take advantage of it for making jigs and other non-airplane-parts. The FJD jig is small enough to print as a single piece, so I was able to easily print both copies of them. The other jigs are large enough that I'd have to glue them together post-printing. Which I chose to do for the FJA jig, which has a curve in it. I only made one of these, the other 3 copies I'll make by using the first as a template, and using a trim bit in my router.
