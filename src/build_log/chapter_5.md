# Chapter 5 - Fuselage Sides

Chapter 4 was about making a bunch of bulkheads which are all internal to the fuselage structure. Chapter 5 involves making external parts - the fuselage sides.

In this chapter, only the interior faces of the fuselage sides will be glassed. The exterior faces will be glassed in chapter 7, when the fuselage is assembled.

## FJ* Jigs

Status:

| Template | Status |
|----------|--------|
| FJA | 1/4 jigs completed! |
| FJB | ✅ |
| FJC | ✅ |
| FJD | ✅ |
| FJE | Rough cut, need to trim and finish. |

The FJ* jigs are used for shaping the longerons and providing a shape for the foam that will be epoxied. For the most part, these are cut from 1 by 8 (nominal) pine board. For the FJA jig, with the curve over the length of it, I chose to 3d print a template for it, which I'll use to copy onto pine board using a trim bit in my router. I also 3d printed the FJD jig, but as I was cutting FJB, I realized that it wasn't that much more effort to also create a pine version of FJD as well. Which works better because it's easier to drill in nails to wood.

## Log

- 2022-06-05, 2022-06-06 - 3D printed FJD jigs & FJA template jig.
- 2022-09-03 - Made FJB, FJC, and FJD jigs. Made most of FJE, but need to trim a little bit more wood to get it to the final shape. Made rough cuts for what will eventually be the FJA jigs.
- 2022-09-04 - A little further progress on one of the FJA jigs.
- 2022-10-15 - Cut one of the FJA jigs to final & correct size. 3 left!
