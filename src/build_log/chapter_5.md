The FJA, FJB, FJC, FJD and FJE jigs are used to give the fuselage sides the desired curves. These are intended to be cut out of 1-inch thick wood (nominally) and for the most part are very straight forward. With the exception of FJA, these are all very simple shapes. To make it easier for me, I wanted to 3d print as much of these jigs as I can. FJD is small enough that I could 3D print both of them on my desktop 3d printer, however the others are large enough that I'd have to print them in parts and join them. FJA is the only one actually worth doing this, because of that curve. I thought of getting a belt-style printer, so that I could print all of these without having to join them. But looking ahead, I don't think that would be a good investment for this. 1 of the 4 FJA jig is printed & joined. The other 3 will be made from wood, using a trim bit in my router and the 3d printed jig as a template.
