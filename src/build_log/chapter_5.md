# Chapter 5 - Fuselage Sides

Chapter 4 was about making a bunch of bulkheads which are all internal to the fuselage structure. Chapter 5 involves making external parts - the fuselage sides.

In this chapter, only the interior faces of the fuselage sides will be glassed. The exterior faces will be glassed in chapter 7, when the fuselage is assembled.

Current Status (Early November, 2022): FJ* jigs are complete, started on the fuselage side forms. Upper longerons nearly complete.

## FJ* Jigs

Status:

| Template | Status |
|----------|--------|
| FJA | ✅ |
| FJB | ✅ |
| FJC | ✅ |
| FJD | ✅ |
| FJE | ✅ |

The FJ* jigs are used for shaping the longerons and providing a shape for the foam that will be epoxied. For the most part, these are cut from 1 by 8 (nominal) pine board. For the FJA jig, with the curve over the length of it, I chose to 3d print a template for it, which I'll use to copy onto pine board using a trim bit in my router. I also 3d printed the FJD jig, but as I was cutting FJB, I realized that it wasn't that much more effort to also create a pine version of FJD as well. Which works better because it's easier to drill in nails to wood.

## Fuselage Side Forms

Status: Ripped a 4x8 sheet of 1/8th inch sheet of masonite into 2x 21 inch by 8 foot sheets, keeping the scrap.

The fuselage sides need a form to rest on, otherwise they'll sag and not be the correct side. Per plans, I got a large sheet of masonite, and used it to create forms for the 2 fuselage sides. I did this by ripping it into 2x 21 inch wide by 8 foot long sheets, keeping the scrap. The scrap will be used to extend the width of these sheets to the necessary 102.5 inches.

## Upper Longerons

Status: Spruce strips are epoxied together. Doublers and stiffeners have been floxed on. Awaiting curing.

Tips:
 - Place the forward doubler about 0.5" back from where the plans indicate. This prevents a canard placement issue that many people report.

The upper longerons (one for each side) are made of 3 long strips of 1" by 0.25" by 105" sitka spruce. Along with a stiffener and 2 doublers, also made of spruce. Because these will go on top of the foam for the fuselage sides, they need to have a slightly tighter curve than the fuselage sides. This is done by laying FJA, FJB, and FJC on their sides, with the ends of FJA and FJC being 0.5" apart, but angled so that they are adjacent by the time they meet FJB. Once you have the jigs set up, you're supposed to join the 105" spruce by painting the interiors, then use clamps & nails to hold the wood to the jigs. I was able to get away using just clamps.

Once the epoxy cured, I added the doublers and stiffeners. Per plans, I pre-drilled holes for nails on the forward doublers and the stiffeners. Then, once the wet flox was mixed up, I painted it on to the forward and aft doublers. For the center stiffeners, I found it easier to paint the flox onto the spruce strips, not the stiffeners. I also added regular flox into the saw holes, to try to counteract the fact that I made way more saw holes than I needed to. Once everything was epoxied and in place, I re-clamped everything, then added weights.

You're supposed to let this whole thing cure for at least a day.

- 2022-09-04 - A little further progress on one of the FJA jigs.
- 2022-10-15 - Cut one of the FJA jigs to final & correct size. 3 left!
- 2022-10-29 - Ripped a 4x8 sheet of masonite into 2x 21 inch by 8 foot sheets.
- 2022-10-30 - Finished the FJ* jigs.
- 2022-11-04 - Assembled & leveled tables. Installed jigs for eventually creating the upper longerons.
- 2022-11-05 - Epoxied the 105" spruce strips together and clamped them to the jigs.
- 2022-11-06 - Shaped doublers & stiffeners. Installed them into place. Upper longerons nearly complete!
