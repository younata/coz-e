# Chapter 7 - Fuselage Exterior

In chapter 7, we take the assembled fuselage built in chapter 6, and do most of the exterior work. This is adding the air intake scoop at the rear, contouring it to have those nice, sleek curves, and glassing everything. At the end of this, the fuselage structure should be at its full strength.

## Air Intake Scoop

## Contouring Floor

## Antennae

## Glassing Floor

I unfortunately had to glass the floor in 2 parts. After applying the first layer of glass, we ran out of epoxy hardener. We only had enough hardener to glass about a third of the second layer of glass. We peel plied everything and ordered more epoxy. We'll continue once the new epoxy arrives.

## Log

- 2023-04-06: Made paper template for air intake scoop.
- 2023-04-08: Traced air intake scoop template onto fuselage structure
- 2023-04-09: Installed 1" and 2" blocks of urethane foam to form basis for air intake scoop forward of the forward landing gear attach bulkhead.
- 2023-04-10: Built birch reinforcement triangles for landing gear box. Started on birch reinforcement blocks for landing gear box -> firewall.
- 2023-04-11: Attempted install of birch reinforcement blocks, but installed support blocks in incorrect locations... somehow? Would have resulted in a skewed install of reinforcement block. Spent ~2 hours removing hot glue after pulling off support blocks.
- 2023-04-14: Finished removing hot glue from aft landing gear bulkhead and lower firewall. Re-shaped support blocks such that the D parts would be level.
- 2023-04-15: Added layer of fiberglass to repair the sanded-through layers on the aft landing gear bulkhead and the lower firewall. Unfortunately, this glass was not properly wet out, and I discovered that it didn't adhere correctly and needed to be removed.
- 2023-04-16: Removed incorrectly applied fiberglass on aft landing gear bulkhead and lower firewall. Replaced with fiberglass that was pre-wetted out prior to applying to the correct surface.
- 2023-04-19(?): Installed support parts A, B, C, and D. Glassed the D parts (horizontal supports) with 2-ply BID, overlapping onto the bulkheads 1-inch. Installed urethane foam on all support parts.
- 2023-04-20: Noticed that the port-side vertical support (Part C) between aft landing gear bulkhead and lower firewall was pushed in and was not flush with the lower longerons. Removed support & urethane foam. Remade support (which I determined was quicker than sanding the support down to the wood) and re-attached it. Also re-attached new urethane foam on top of the support. Verified that everything was in the correct spot before closing up.
- 2023-04-21: Measured, cut, and fit foam panels to fill out the air intake scoop from the aft landing gear bulkhead and lower firewall.
- 2023-04-22: Installed foam panels for air intake scoop between aft landing gear bulkhead and lower firewall. Installed additional urethane foam to fill space between start of air intake scoop (as calculated) and what was previously installed.
- 2023-04-23: Built sanding block for sanding naca scoop (glued a sanding belt to a 3ft long 2x4). Applied packing tape to area forward of air intake scoop to prevent accidentally sanding through that foam. No actual sanding, though.
- 2023-04-25: Sanded urethane foam from naca scoop down to the correct shape.
- 2023-04-29: Glassed inner part of naca scoop.
- 2023-05-01: Started repair of naca scoop layup.
- 2023-05-05: Finished repair of the naca scoop layup.
- 2023-05-08: Made scans of the large M-size drawings, 3d-printed contour template for sanding the forward half of the fuselage floor to contour.
- May and June 2023: Sanding fuselage floor to contour.
- 2023-06-18, 2023-06-19: Sanded 1/16th inch depression around landing brake. Placed landing gear in place (supergluing between masking tape).
- 2023-06-21: Built up 1-inch wide "skirt" around landing brake of tape. Sanded 1/16th inch depression in forward half of fuselage floor.
- 2023-06-22: Sanded 1/16th inch depression in forward half of fuselage sides.
- 2023-06-27: Started work figuring out antennae layout. First pass: Marker beacon, 1 nav, and 1 glideslope.
- 2023-06-28: Committed to removing the marker beacon. Will also combine the nav and glideslope into a single antenna.
- 2023-07-08: Routed slots for combined nav1 and glideslope antenna. Routed slots for coax for that antenna. Cut length of coax for nav/glideslope antenna.
- 2023-07-09: Cut copper tape for nav1 and glideslope antenna. Soldered copper tapes to coax to make nav/glideslope antenna. Installed and potted antenna/glideslope antenna.
- 2023-07-10 through 2023-07-22: Prepped fuselage floor for glassing. Sanding, sanding and more sanding.
- 2023-07-23: Glassed approximately 2/3rds of fuselage floor before we ran out of epoxy hardener. Covered floor in peel ply and ordered more epoxy.
